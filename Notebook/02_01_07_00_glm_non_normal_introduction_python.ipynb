        "\n",
        "Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a flexible extension of ordinary linear regression that allow modeling response variables following distributions other than the normal (Gaussian) distribution. They are particularly useful for non-normal continuous data, such as positive skewed values (e.g., costs, times), proportions, or rates, where assumptions like normality, homoscedasticity, or unbounded ranges do not hold.\n",

        "A GLM has three core components:\n",
        "- **Random component**: The probability distribution of the response variable $Y$, typically from the exponential family (e.g., Gamma, Beta).\n",
        "- **Systematic component**: A linear predictor $\\eta = X\\beta$, where $X$ is the design matrix of predictors and $\\beta$ are coefficients.\n",
        "- **Link function**: $g(\\mu) = \\eta$, connecting the expected value $\\mu = E(Y)$ to the linear predictor. Common links include log, logit, or inverse.\n",
        "\n",
        "For non-normal continuous data, GLMs handle positive-only values, bounded ranges (e.g., [0,1]), or data with excess zeros/inflations. They are estimated via maximum likelihood, and diagnostics (e.g., deviance residuals) assess fit. Below, I explain the specified models, focusing on their distributions, typical applications, link functions, and key features."

Key models include: Gamma regression for positive skewed data, Inverse Gaussian for highly skewed continuous data, Beta regression for proportions, Zero-One Inflated Beta for proportions with excess boundaries, Fractional regression for bounded ratios, Dirichlet regression for compositional data, and Tweedie regression for data with a mix of zeros and positive values. Each model addresses unique challenges such as skewness, boundedness, and zero-inflation, making GLMs versatile for diverse applications in fields like economics, ecology, and engineering. Proper model selection, fitting, and diagnostics are crucial for accurate inference and prediction in non-normal continuous data contexts."
